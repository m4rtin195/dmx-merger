# dmx-merger

The practical part of my bachelor thesis, a device based on AVR microcontrollers, which joins two DMX512 signal streams together.

The project consists of 2 MCUs:
- `ATmega324P` that serves as a *receiver*, and "master" controller in the device, and
- `ATmega8` that serves as a *sender*, generating output DMX <u>signal</u>
